# CPlaylist
CPlaylist is a simple application that developed for testing and improving my kotlin skill
Some functions of this application using tools from external libs such as Glide, Youtube API.
To communicate with server API, I using OkHttp3 and Retrofit2 with RxJava2.
Stucture of this project, I trying to write as MVVM pattern.
This project didn't include any binding but I use synthetic to connect between xmls and kotlin classes.
Thank you.
